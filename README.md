This project was created as the 1st Assignment on the course
"Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments"
by University of Colorado Boulder on coursera.

Assignment details: You are to write a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, you will need to reorder this data set from large to small. All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, you will need to print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation. You will need to submit a version controlled repository of these 3 files.

Additional information:
5 types of sort algorithms are implemented
